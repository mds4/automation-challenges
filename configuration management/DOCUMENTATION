This creates five virtual machines using Vagrant and Virtualbox which apply
the appropriate puppet configuration (located under puppet/) to fill out the
widgetfile template as requested.

By design, box03 does not have a value for the widget fact, box04 is initially
down, and box05 does not execute the widget puppet module at all.

To deploy, just execute ./bootstrap.sh which will bring up 01, 02, 03, and 05,
run the status report, bring up 04, run the status report again, and then tear
down all five VMs.

To report on the boxes manually, run ./check_status.sh (bootstrap.sh
automatically runs this).
